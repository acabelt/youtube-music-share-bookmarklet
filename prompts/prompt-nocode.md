create an astrojs layout that looks similar to youtube music listing a bunch of songs in a playlist like window. it should work on mobile and desktop, light mode and dark mode support. use tailwind version 4, so no tailwind.config.js, but a global.css file in /src/styles/global.css.

at the top of the playlist should be an embedded video of the very first entry so people can just click to play it.

when possible the interface should support autoplay of next song or even better have support to enable/disable autoplay.

the interface should store the choosen song/entry in localstorage so on the next visit the player knows which song to show as active. it needs to be updated everytime a new entry/song starts or get chosen.
