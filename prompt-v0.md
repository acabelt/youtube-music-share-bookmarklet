Develop an Astro.js layout that mimics the user interface of YouTube Music's playlist view, presenting a list of songs. The design should be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and functionality across both mobile and desktop devices. Implement light and dark mode support for enhanced user experience. Utilize Tailwind CSS version 4 for styling, incorporating a global.css file located in /src/styles/global.css to manage the application's styling. At the top of the playlist, embed a video corresponding to the first song entry, enabling users to initiate playback directly. Integrate an autoplay feature that automatically plays the next song in the playlist upon completion of the current song. Include an option to enable or disable the autoplay functionality. Implement local storage to persist the currently selected song, ensuring that the playlist resumes from the last played song upon subsequent visits. The local storage should update whenever a new song is selected or begins playing.
